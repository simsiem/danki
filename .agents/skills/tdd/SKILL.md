# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle — consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read the CONTEXT file (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Follow a behavior-driven approach: describe the behavior you expect before writing the test, and ensure that each test corresponds to a specific behavior slice. Define the behavior in a feature file. You should already have received the information about the location and format of the file. Define the test cases as scenarios within that feature file. Use Scenario Outlines where appropriate to keep the file concise and logical. Implement the scenario execution in a corresponding test file. As a result, requirements and tests are understood together. They are specified along a clear seam.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists — and survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams — where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything — agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

When the shape of that interface is itself in question — how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose — use the `/codebase-design` skill for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled** — mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological** — the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing** — writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead — one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Add or extend the scenarios in the relevant feature file as failing tests first. Implement the scenario in a test runner. Then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features. Create a new feature file when no existing file is the right home.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see the `code-review` skill), not the red → green implementation cycle.
- **Keep permanent docs in sync with the behavior.** Follow the project's documentation rules. Ensure that implementation changes are reflected in the relevant documentation (behavior and scenario descriptions), and that the documentation accurately describes the current behavior.

# Rules for behavior description

When defining the language for and the structure of scenarios, keep the following in mind:

- Walk along real user journeys, describing behavior from the user's perspective. Avoid: API testing style.
- Focus on reusable small steps. Each Given/When/Then statement should capture a distinct piece of behavior that can be composed with others to describe complex scenarios.
